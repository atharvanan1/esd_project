Enter Programming Mode
The following algorithm puts the device in parallel (high-voltage) programming mode:
1. Set prog_enable pins listed in Table 27-12 on page 246 to “0000”, RESET pin to 0V and VCC to 0V.
2. Apply 4.5 to 5.5V between VCC and GND.
Ensure that VCC reaches at least àpçV within the next 20μs.
3. Wait 20 to 60μs, and apply 11.5 to 12.5V to RESET.
4. Keep the Prog_enable pins unchanged for at least10μs after the high-voltage has been applied to ensure the
prog_enable signature has been latched.
5. Wait at least 300μs before giving any parallel programming commands.
6. Exit programming mode by power the device down or by bringing RESET pin to 0V.
If the rise time of the VCC is unable to fulfill the requirements listed above, the following alternative algorithm can be used.
1. Set prog_enable pins listed in Table 27-12 on page 246 to “0000”, RESET pin to 0V and VCC to 0V.
2. Apply 4.5 to 5.5V between VCC and GND.
3. Monitor VCC, and as soon as VCC reaches 0.9 to 1.1V, apply 11.5 to 12.5V to RESET.
4. Keep the prog_enable pins unchanged for at least 10μs after the high-voltage has been applied to ensure the
prog_enable signature has been latched.
5. Wait until VCC actually reaches 4.5 to 5.5V before giving any parallel programming commands.
6. Exit programming mode by power the device down or by bringing RESET pin to 0V.
